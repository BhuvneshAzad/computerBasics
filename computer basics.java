// Assignment-1
// Q1. What is a Computer?
// Ans. A computer is a machine that accepts information (in the form of digitised data) and
// processes it in accordance with a programme, piece of software, or set of instructions that
// specify how the information should be handled

// Q2. What is RAM?
// Ans. Ram stands for Random-access memory. RAM is the main memory in a computer. RAM
// is a temporary memory bank where your computer stores data it needs to retrieve quickly RAM
// is volatile. This means that information is kept in RAM while the computer is running, but it is
// erased when the machine is powered off. The operating system and other files are frequently
// loaded from an HDD or SSD into RAM when the computer is restarted.

// Q3. Where is data stored in a computer?
// Ans. Data is stored in various components of a computer system, depending on its type and
// purpose.
// Hard Disk Drives (HDD): Data is usually stored in the magnetic platters of the hard disk drive.
// The HDD stores data even when the computer is turned off.
// Solid-State Drives (SSD): Data is stored on flash memory chips within an SSD, and it is also
// stored even when the computer is turned off.
// Random Access Memory (RAM): Data is stored temporarily in RAM while the computer is
// running. When the computer is turned off, any data stored in RAM is lost.
// Cache memory: Data is stored temporarily in cache memory, which is a smaller and faster type
// of memory that helps to speed up the computer's performance.
// Optical discs: Data is stored on optical discs like CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs, using a laser
// to read and write data onto a reflective surface.
// USB flash drives: Data is stored on flash memory chips in a small and portable USB drive.
// Cloud storage: Data can also be stored remotely on servers hosted by a cloud storage provider,
// accessible through the internet.
// Overall, data can be stored in various locations and formats depending on the requirements of
// the computer system and its users.

// Q4. What is that input device used to type text and numbers on a document in the computer
// system?
// Ans. The input device used to type text and numbers on a document in a computer system is
// called a keyboard. A keyboard is a device with a set of keys that are used to input letters,
// numbers, and symbols into a computer. When a key is pressed on the keyboard, it sends an
// electrical signal to the computer, which interprets the signal and displays the corresponding
// character on the screen. The keyboard is one of the primary input devices used with a computer,
// and it is essential for tasks such as writing documents, sending emails, and browsing the web.

// Q5. What are the output devices?
// Ans. The output is what we get back from the command we gave the computer through the
// input device. The monitor is the device that is utilised the most since commands are entered
// via the keyboard, and the outcome is shown on the monitor after processing.

// Q6. Which is the input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen?
// Ans. The input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen is called a
// pointing device. The most common pointing device is a mouse, but there are also other types
// of pointing devices such as touchpads, trackballs, and pointing sticks.

// Q7. Which language is directly understood by the computer without a translation program?
// Ans. The only language directly understood by a computer without a translation program is
// machine language, also known as "machine code". Machine language is a low-level
// programming language consisting of binary code, which is a series of 1's and 0's that represent
// the instructions and data that a computer can execute.

// Q8. What are Input devices?
// Ans. Input devices are devices that allow users to input data or instructions into a computer or
// other electronic device. They are used to communicate with and control a computer system,
// and they are essential for performing a wide variety of tasks. Some common input devices
// include:
// Keyboard - used to type text and numbers into a computer.
// Mouse - used to navigate the computer screen and perform various functions such as selecting,
// dragging and dropping.
// Touchpad - used as a substitute for a mouse, especially in laptops.
// Trackball - used as a substitute for a mouse, but instead of moving the device, the user moves
// a ball on top of it.
// Scanner - used to input images or text from printed pages into a computer system.
// Microphone - used to input audio into a computer, such as voice commands or for recording
// audio.
// Joystick - used for gaming or controlling movement in simulations and other applications.
// Webcam - used for capturing video and images of oneself or the surrounding environment.
// Digital Pen or Stylus - used to write or draw on a digital screen, particularly useful in graphics
// or design applications.
